# Contributing

This repository is the C++ daemon client for Kryptic (`kryptic-daemon-client`).

## What we accept

## What we do not accept

- Storing or logging secret values in plaintext
- Breaking changes to the daemon IPC protocol without a coordinated Daemon release

- Public GitHub issues for vulnerabilities (email security@kryptic.dev)

## Development

```bash
cmake --build build && ctest --test-dir build
```

Protocol details: [Kryptic.Daemon/PROTOCOL.md](https://github.com/dev-kryptic/Kryptic.Daemon/blob/main/PROTOCOL.md).

## Releasing

Merges to `main` run tests only. Publish by pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag (or
re-running the workflow with that tag). The tag is the version. Leave
release-worthy notes under **Unreleased**. The publish job creates the
`## X.Y.Z` section from that body if it is missing (or a one-line fallback).

## Licensing of contributions
